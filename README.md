Diabetic Retinopathy Detection System

This project focuses on the development of a deep learning model to detect diabetic retinopathy, a condition caused by high blood sugar levels damaging the retina, potentially leading to blindness. The model uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with the VGG16 architecture to classify the severity of the condition into four categories: normal, mild, moderate, and severe.

I built a web application using Python, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS that allows users to upload fundus images. The system then analyzes the images and provides an assessment of the diabetic retinopathy stage.
